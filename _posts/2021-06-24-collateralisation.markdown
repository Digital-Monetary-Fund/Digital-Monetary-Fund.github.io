At the Digital Monetary Fund are currently working on the guidelines, policies and procedures for the treasury function. 

There has been a lot of discussion about the efficient management of collateralisation. Modelling is being performed to test the effectiveness of holding collateral in major digital assets, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, and using synthetic instruments to hedge against markets movements and risk to the underlying instrument.

A formal policy document on this topic will be published next month.
