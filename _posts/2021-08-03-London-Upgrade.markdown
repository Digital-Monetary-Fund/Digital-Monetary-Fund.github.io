The Ethereum London Fork will take place sometime around 8:45 pm AEST on August 5th (Block Height 12,965,000). We are making all necessary preparations for the smoothest transition through the fork process.

To protect against unexpected network behavior at the time of the fork, we will halt all Ethereum network-based transactions for approximately 4 hours to guarantee a smooth transition. We will do everything we can to ensure this will be as short as possible.

Weâ€™re continuously monitoring the Ethereum community for a possible network split and will be prepared for that scenario.
