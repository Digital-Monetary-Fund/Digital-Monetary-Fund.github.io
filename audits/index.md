To preserve the integrity of Digital Monetary Fund blockchain assets we regularly review and have our Smart Contracts code audited by external experts. These reviews and audits check for security vulnerabilities, blockchain efficiency and that best practises  are adopted.

All Digital Monetary Fund Smart Contract code is developed using the "Solidity" programming language. <br />
