Consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for governance. Throughout history innovation in governance has enabled an increasingly more direct relationship between a community and those that make and enforce community rules. For example in a democracy, the intent is that rule makers are also community members, not a separate class creating and enforcing laws from some citadel on high.

For the sake of legitimacy, those who make laws should live by them and shoulder any burden that comes from them, which happens when the community is both the governor and the governed. Of course there's always room for improvement. This is where Web3 technology as a phenomenal coordination tool has allowed humans to innovate governance once again — into Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)s.

DAOs give communities who share values the ability to organize and govern with maximum consent and legitimacy. Community rules are pre-made and transparently executed by code on a blockchain. And DAO communities are opt in, voluntary associations. Perhaps most importantly though, DAO communities are owned by each individual member through ownership of the network's token. This aligns individual and group incentives towards everyone's benefit, since actions that keep the network safe and prosperous reward token holders with a higher token value.

In DAO models where tokens give voting power, a community may reward positive actions like participation with more tokens. This gives extra influence to those who are most active in the community. Through ownership and influence DAO community members are motivated towards community benefit.

DAO communities share values and governance, and allow members to have ownership where they live, play, or work. And they are becoming increasingly common in Web3 communities!
