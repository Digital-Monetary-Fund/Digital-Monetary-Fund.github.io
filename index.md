**Financial Sector for the 2020s:** Building a more Democratic, Inclusive and Transparent Monetary System.

The Digital Monetary Fund (DMF) is a Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that operates a portfolioÂ of next-generation smart stablecoins in a multichain environment. DMF aims to use blockchain technology to implement the principles of Modern Monetary Theory for public benefit.

The Digital Monetary Fund aims to link national fiat currencies with stable block-chain based crypto currencies to enable friction-less, risk-free and universal monetary flows. We will do this by using blockchain digital assets and networks for an inflation-proof, transparent and trust-less monetary system.

The DMF team comes from a broad financial markets and technology background and is dedicated to making a more modern and democratic monetary system. We welcome participation from others who share the same ideals.
